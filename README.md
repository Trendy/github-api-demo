# Github API Demo

## Running

### Requirements
- Node.js 12+
- NPM 6+

### Setup
You will need two environment variables to run the server:

GITHUB_API_URL="https://api.github.com" #This is defaulted locally
GITHUB_TOKEN="" #Locally it will read $GITHUB_APP_TOKEN so you don't need to expose your token
```

npm i && npm start
